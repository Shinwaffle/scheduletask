# scheduletask
Script to quickly create google calendar events from the command line. I created this script as a means to quickly jot down ideas for later. Pulling up GNOME Calendar and using my moues is *of course* too much work.

I'm working on a PyPI release soon, didn't realize I couldn't just *upload* it and it works. I thought computers were magic, damnit!
# Requirements

## Google Cloud Project
You can install the package on PyPI:

`pip install -U scheduletask`

Once downloaded, follow the Prerequisites in this link : https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python. The downloaded credentials should be renamed to credentials.json.

On Windows, they should be put in as: `C:\Users\$USER\.credentials\credentials.json`
(If your windows installation is not on C: but on D: (or X:, so on) put it there)

On Linux, they should be put in as:
`/home/$USER/.credentials/credentials.json`

On Mac, they should be put in as:
`/Users/$USER/.credentials/credentials.json`

## Google Calendar Simple API

https://github.com/kuzmoyev/google-calendar-simple-api

`pip install gcsa`

### Note for Mac

When testing this in a vm, I had to download this library with `sudo` privileges.
Either my vm is not setup right, or that's just what you have to do.

## Beautiful Date

https://github.com/kuzmoyev/beautiful-date

`pip install beauitful-date`

You also need an enviroment variable called "SCHEDULE_EMAIL" with your email. These are instructions on how to create them temporarily for the means of testing.

How to create one on Linux/Mac: 
`export SCHEDULE_EMAIL="example@example.org"`
To make it persistent, add that line to your .bashrc/.zshrc (either/or)

How to create one on Windows (Powershell):
`$env:SCHEDULE_EMAIL = "example@example.org"`
To make it persistent, in a Powershell session:
``[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SCHEDULE_EMAIL', 'YOUR_EMAIL', 'MACHINE')``
Replace `YOUR_EMAIL` with your actual email.

# Roadmap:
How to setup PATH to execute from command line.
Perhaps provide detailed instructions on getting your `credentials.json`.
Also, timezones seem to be kinda weird with it.
Create some GitHub Actions workflows to automate package publishing alongside testing (For Windows, Linux, and Mac(Soon)).
Also, add a whole bunch of more features (obviously) alongside pip automatically installing gcsa and beautiful-date (I'm too dumb to do it right now)
